I have developed a front end using Angular JS

I tried to implement the Web service Client Using SPRING OAUTH2, but could not complete. 

I went with a workaround solution has developing a temporary access to the MOCK service. I was able to connect to fetch the data.

Kindly let know if any further discussion to clarify your queries.
